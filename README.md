# Trails of the Abyss

## Overview

**"Trails of the Abyss"** is a single-player RPG with a turn-based combat system and randomized elements. Players lead a team of three adventurers to explore the Abyssal Dungeon, overcoming perilous trials and uncovering dark secrets.

With five unique character classes to choose from—Knight, Archer, Mage, Barbarian, and Sorcerer—players must strategically build their team, equip powerful items, and navigate a series of battles to reach the heart of the dungeon and confront the ultimate foe. The game consists of five stages, each featuring three random enemies. Battles are turn-based, where both the player's team and enemies take turns performing actions. If all characters in the player’s team run out of health, the player loses. If all five stages are cleared, the player wins.

## Background Story

In the ancient land of **Demini**, whispers of a dark and treacherous place—known as the Abyss—have haunted people for generations. A labyrinth of shifting shadows and malevolent creatures, the Abyss is said to be a prison for a powerful entity sealed away centuries ago by the **Eldrin Order**, a coalition of the most skilled warriors, mystics, and scholars.

But time has worn down even the mightiest defenses, and the seal keeping the entity contained has begun to crack. As the Abyss churns with growing chaos, it spills forth its corruption into the surface world, unleashing monstrous horrors and spreading despair.

A prophecy emerges—a glimmer of hope amid the rising darkness. It speaks of three brave souls who will descend into the depths of the Abyss, confront its trials, and uncover the secret to sealing the entity once and for all. The prophecy does not name these heroes, leaving the choice to those willing to rise above fear and take the risk.

You are one of these chosen adventurers, assembling a group of three from among the bravest classes in the land:

- **Knight**: The shield of the group, unwavering and noble. Their armor and sword serve as a beacon of hope in the darkest moments.
- **Archer**: A master of precision and stealth. They strike from the shadows with deadly accuracy.
- **Mage**: A scholar of arcane arts. Their spells shape the battlefield and pierce even the most formidable defenses.
- **Barbarian**: A force of primal fury. They charge headlong into danger, smashing through obstacles with brute strength.
- **Sorcerer**: A wielder of forbidden magic. Their abilities are unpredictable yet devastating.

Together, these adventurers must form a balanced team to overcome the unique challenges of the Abyss.
